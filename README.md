Project 1:
  Required Tasks
  Build a UI layout for multiple Activities.
  Launch these Activities via Intent.
  Fetch data from themovieDB API

Project 2:
Add additional functionality to the app we built in Stage 1.

  We add more information to our movie details view:
  - allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
  - allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
  - allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that we maintain and do not require an API request*.
  - modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
