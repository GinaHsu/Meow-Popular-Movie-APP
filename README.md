# Meow Popular Movie APP
Udacity- Associate Android Developer Fast Track: https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818

This is a project to build an APP for the popular movies searching.

Note: For NetworkUtils.java, I removed my API KEY base on Udacity's Popular Movies App Implementation Guide,

MPORTANT: PLEASE REMOVE YOUR API KEY WHEN SHARING CODE PUBLICALLY If you ever upload your code to a public GitHub repo to share with other students or instructors, itâ€™s illegal to include your personal themoviedb.org API key. Please remove it and note in a README where it came from, so someone else trying to run your code can create their own key and will quickly know where to put it. Instructors and code reviewers will expect this behavior for any public GitHub code.

Please place your own API KEY for the variable- final static String MYAPIKEY = "put your API KEY".
