# Meow Popular Movie APP
Udacity- Associate Android Developer Fast Track: https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818

This is a project to build an APP for the popular movies searching.

Note: For NetworkUtils.java, I stored the API key in the file- gradle.properties, that is a local file loacated in C:\Users\xxx\.gradle (xxx is your user name), is not uploaded to the version control.

How to run the movie app?
Create a file named gradle.properties in your local(C:\Users\xxx\.gradle (xxx is your user name)) and added a line, MyMovieDBApiKey="XXXXX", in that file. Then during build time, Gradle will generate the BuildConfig file to store some build-related constants.
